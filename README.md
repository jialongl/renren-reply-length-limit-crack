This is just a quick hack of the site's HTML, to forgo the char limit of replies.  
Automated by writing a simple Chrome extension.

**Important**

* There is a hard limit (500) of char count, imposed by the server,
nothing much I can do about that. 
* Interestingly, the char limit (imposed by JS) only appears on certain places --  
e.g. replies to status updates/shares on the homepage, lines in chat window etc.  
The limit doesn't seem to exist if you actually go to read the share and make your comments.

**Possible TODOs**

* Make it work with status update (it only works with status/article replies
right now).
